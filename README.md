# ec601 Final Project: Coded Aperture Imaging System

 
## Product Mission
Our goal is to develop a program that runs a coded aperture mask through various simulated optical tests and outputs the results of these tests to help the user determine in which applications the mask would perform optimally. Additionally, these results will be saved to a simple database that allows the user to search through. Time permitting, we will build a physical setup for the coded aperture system, and extra time permitting we would like to build an entire system of which our coded aperture would be just one part (e.g. camera or telescope). 

  ### User Stories (for coded aperture applications)
  
  I, the astronomer, want to be able to view images with a lensless telescope.

  I, the physician, want to be able to perform x-ray scans without lenses.

  I, the photographer, want to be able to take low light pictures.

  I, the photographer, want to be able to take pictures without the glare effect from a lens.

  I, the scientist, want to be able to capture images without the use of a lens.

  I, the scientist, want to be able to take microscopic images in a space where a lens cannot fit.

  I, the astronaut, want to be able to capture images in space without a lens.

  I, the researcher, want a developed aperture that is adaptable to use in my imaging device.

  I, the developer, want an adaptable coded aperture to save time developing my own product.
  
  ### User Stories (for analysis program)
  
  I, the scientist/researcher/student, want to be able to test my coded aperture in various optical simulations.
  
  I, the scientist/researcher/student, want to have a database to search what kind of coded aperture works best in a given      application.

  ### Customers

  Our target audeiences are photographers and researchers involved in both focusing and imaging.

  ### Minimum Value Product (MVP)

  MVP: Design a simulation program that runs a coded aperture mask through various optical tests.



## Product Analysis

  ### Competitors (for coded aperture masks and applications)
  - UT-Battelle LLC (CA Imaging System): can image on the order of microns
  - Qinetiq Ltd (CA Imaging System): allows imaging of different fields of view, coded mask is reconfigurable
  - Huang et. al. (CA X-Ray Imaging System): can analyze enveloped material, limited to x-ray
  
  ### Competitors (for analysis program/database)
  - Some PhD theses have discussed the issue and provided individual case studies
  - Currently no existing database
