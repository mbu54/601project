# ec601 Final Project: Coded Aperture Imaging System

 
## Product Mission
Our goal is to create a unique coded aperture imaging system that will ideally be versatile engough that it can be used in many different applications as expressed through our user stories. Time permitting we will build a physical setup for the coded aperture system and extra time permitting we would like to build an entire application system (e.g. camera or telescope) 
  ### User Stories

  I, the astronomer, want to be able to view images with a lensless telescope.

  I, the physician, want to be able to perform x-ray scans without lenses.

  I, the photographer, want to be able to take low light pictures.

  I, the photographer, want to be able to take pictures without the glare effect from a lens.

  I, the scientist, want to be able to capture images without the use of a lens.

  I, the scientist, want to be able to take microscopic images in a space where a lens cannot fit.

  I, the astronaut, want to be able to capture images in space without a lens.

  I, the researcher, want a developed aperture that is adaptable to use in my imaging device.

  I, the developer, want an adaptable coded aperture to save time developing my own product.

  ### Customers

  Our target audeinces are photographers and researchers involved in both focusing and imaging.

  ### Minimum Value Product (MVP)
