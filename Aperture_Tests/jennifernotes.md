While building the test for the far-field setup, I noticed that the MATLAB code we have been analyzing as an example has a very good setup to run one convolution algorithm with different images for different tests instead of making different convolutions for each test. If all fields can be represented as different kinds of images, we can save significant effort in the algorithm for testing the usefulness of each aperture.
